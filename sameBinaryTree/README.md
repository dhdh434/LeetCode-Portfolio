# LeetCode 100 Same Tree
## Explanation and steps of code  
1) check if the children nodes are equal and pass in the next level using recursion

## Time Efficiency  
O(n) because it must itereate over each node  

## Problem Explanation  
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

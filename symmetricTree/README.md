# LeetCode 101 Symmetric Tree
## Explanation and steps of code  
1) check if the children values match. Pass in the opposite children to the next level of the tree using recursion.

## Time Efficiency  
O(n) it must iterate over all nodes in the tree.  

## Problem Explanation  
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

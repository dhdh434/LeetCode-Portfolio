# LeetCode 226 Invert Binary Tree
## Explanation and steps of code  
1) get the the children nodes and switch them. Call the function recursively passing in the next children nodes

## Time Efficiency  
O(n) because it must itereate over each node in the tree 

## Problem Explanation  
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

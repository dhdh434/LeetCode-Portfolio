# LeetCode-Portfolio
This is my LeetCode portfolio, where I’ve completed over 16 coding challenges. Each problem includes a dedicated README.md with a clear explanation of the problem, a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, and an analysis of the algorithm’s time complexity. The portfolio covers a variety of data structures, including hash tables, linked lists, binary search trees, and heaps, and many of the solutions incorporate recursion.


# What is LeetCode?
LeetCode is a widely used online platform that provides a vast collection of coding challenges aimed at helping developers improve their algorithmic thinking and programming skills. The problems cover fundamental computer science topics such as data structures, dynamic programming, recursion, graph theory, and system design. Working through LeetCode problems not only sharpens problem-solving abilities but also strengthens coding fluency in languages like Python, Java, and C++.
